    question: "What problems does Pluto solve?",
    answer:
      "Large publishers oligopolizing the market with their past influence have generated excessive commercial profits in scholarly communications. High subscription fees, submission fee and APC created access barriers to research achievements. Moreover, publication bias and performance focused evaluation system hindered information sharing and communication among researchers, resulting in duplicated experiments. Publication procedures without profound standard waste a lot of time and resources. Researchers are having trouble in getting research funding due to structural problems. These problems can be solved in Pluto platform by making academic communication transparent and independent from centralized authority. ",

    question: "What is peer review?",
    answer:
      "In traditional journal publication model, when an author submits a paper to a journal, the editor of the journal requests the peer reviewers to evaluate it. In general, two or three researchers in the same field will examine various aspects such as the scientific value of the paper or whether the hypotheses and results are aligned properly. Usually reviewers are anonymous from the author, which causes serious problems like manipulation and low quality of reviews. Pluto aims to solve problems in current peer review model by introducing public peer review model, meaning any participant on the platform can review and every information in review process is transparently recorded by using blockchain technology.
