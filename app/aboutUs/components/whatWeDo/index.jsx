            We provide a SaaS solution that includes both a discovery and
            academic search engine customized for your institution. <br />
            It also comes with a consultancy-based solution, in which we provide
            real feedback on how you can cut back on your subscriptions based on
            what your researchers need and donâ€™t need, as well as how to provide
            the most resourceful environment for your scholars and researchers.
            <br />
            <br />
            We help walk through your subscriptions and bundles, and visually
            compare search results to identify what improvements and reductions
            can be made for your university.
